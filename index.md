# The World of Mathematics

Welcome! This site is an attempt to feature some of my favorite math resources on the Web, so without further ado, let's get started!

- [**Mathematics — Wikipedia**](#): This is the de-facto portal of mathematics on the Web, and features a story of mathematics that is incredibly fascinating. When mathemaics reads like a novel, you know that it got to be good. And this happens to be one of them.
- [**The Glossary of Higher Mathematical Jargon**](https://mathvault.ca/math-glossary/): When you want to learn some serious math but have no clue where to start, what do you do? Well, you start with its language of course — more specifically the jargon of mathematics. When it comes to these words, this guide is definitely not in the lacking. If anything, it will take you on a ride from "abstract nonsense" all the way to "without loss of generality".
- [**Introduction to Higher Mathematics**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZzHxk_TPOStgPtqRZ6KzmkUQBQ8TSWVX): When it comes to math beyond the K-12 level, videos are often not the type of modality. But alas, there are times where math videos can strike gold, and this is one of them. Organized as a 19-part series, this resource will venture into an abstract world which you might or might not have seen. From proof, logic, set theory, relation to number theory, modular arithmetic, topology and ring theory, it seems that there's enough of mathematical goodness for just about everyone.

All right folks. These resources should keep you busy for a while already. So until next time and may Math be your lord and shepherd many years down the road!
